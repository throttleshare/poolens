More complex than purpose-made pool borates but significantly cheaper. Look up the borate-from-Borax method online." }

          notes: "Maintains pool at 50 ppm borate, which provides three benefits: (1) stabilizes pH against drift, (2) water feels noticeably softer and silkier, (3) reduces algae growth and chlorine demand by ~15-20%. A one-time addition that persists all season unless water is diluted. Highly recommended for pools with chronic pH fluctuation problems.",
